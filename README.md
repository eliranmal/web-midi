# web-midi
an experiment with midi and the web

---


## run

    npm install
    npm start

*this demo only works on webkit engines.*


## play

just plug in your [m-audio axiom 25][2] midi controller, and have a blast!
other midi controllers might work, too! possibly maybe!

you can also manually adjust the various controls with the mouse/keyboard, but that's wayyy less fun.
